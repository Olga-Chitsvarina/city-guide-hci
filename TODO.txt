== David's Critiques Not Covered Above == 
I feel there's a lot of competing content, right panel on the home looks just as important as the top panel. Maybe make those white so they blend with the interface more.

Calendar - is red selected? Maybe have a speech bubble point to the selected date.
Red makes it look like the one that is currently selected. Maybe there's a better way to show that?

Maybe get rid of strokes (borders)?

Place profile page - photo on left
Good use of visual variables, but maybe use a consistent colour scheme? Try Adobe Kuler.

Error messages.

What is obscurity rating again?

Blacklist?

Friends - does it mean you can search for people and add them? I feel like that has a lot of functionality that would need to be unpacked.

Highlight current page on the top panel


== Partially Resolved / WIP ==
(None yet)
Get rid of arrows on sliders
Shift up day information (Calendar)


== Resolved ==
~Move menu bar on homepage to left side~
~Make buttons smaller on the home page (David asked during the presentation)~
~Change about to info (I think Luke suggested to do it during the evaluation)~
~Remove arrow from go to home button. One girl asked us to do so during the presentation.~
make background color of buttons less extreme, did David say that? I just remember he wanted us to change the color of logo
~Change text on homepage bar to logo or change colour of text~
~Text over hover icons for GlanceView~
~Change colour of progress bar GlanceView~
~Highlight current view~
