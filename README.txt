To run the code, either open the solution’s .sln file in this folder or navigate to the Debug folder to run the .exe.

The following two "accounts" exist as default users you may log in as:
* Username: "Travor Trapp"	Password: "123"
* Username: "Loren Lane"	Password: "123"

The idea was to keep Stuart Stevens, our "newcomer" persona, account-less to simulate him visiting the site for the first time in particular.

For account creation, emails already taken up are "travor@email.com" and "loren@email.com", in case you want to test account creation errors.
That is, the "register" page will give an error if you try and use either of these two.
Or, of course, you could create a new account with a new email, then try and reuse that same email, and get an error.
Either works.
